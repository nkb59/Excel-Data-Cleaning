# Excel-Data-Cleaning

Hi everyone,

I have taken a medium sized raw data set pertaining to Bike Sales and have cleaned the data up so it can be better used for Data Visualization purposes.

The bike_buyers tab is the initial data with no modifications/clean up done to it.

The Working Sheet tab has the cleaned data which better serves a purpose for our use.

The Pivot Table tab has the different pivot tables that we are ultimately using to create charts, etc...

The final dashboard tab in the excel sheet contains the data that would be ultimately presented in data vizulation form.

Thanks :)
